Hi, I am Tobin! I have an international background and am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Science with a concentration in Data Analytics and Management at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During my undergraduate and graduate studies, I participated in technical internships. Following graduation, I want to become a data analyst.
